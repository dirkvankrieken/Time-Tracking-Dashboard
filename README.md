### What I learned

- I learned to use TailwindCSS to apply all of the needed CSS styles, such as the grid layout, positioning, colors, images.
- I learned to use Vite Javascript Framework for developing (mainly because I wanted to use tailwindcss)
- I learned to deploy the page as a Vite-app to Github Pages
- I learned to use a .json file for data and the javascript fetch api to fetch data from a json file
- Improved problem solving capabilities by using Google and ChatGPT
